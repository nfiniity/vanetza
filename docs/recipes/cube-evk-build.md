# Building for CUBE EVK

The CUBE EVK from [nfiniity](https://www.nfiniity.com/#portfolio) fully supports the Vanetza stack and its socktap application. An integrated V2X module listens for requests whether from a local or remote application. The communication protocol between host and V2X module is covered in Google's Protobuf that is used in the respective link-layer implementation.

## Configuration
Before building and running socktap you need to configure the V2X module and the WiFi once.

### V2X Radio Configuration - C-V2X or DSRC
First of all select your desired radio configuration using the `v2xconfig` tool on the EVK:

    :::shell
    # start dsrc or cv2x and enable auto-start
    cube> v2xconfig start enable dsrc 

### Connect to your local WiFi
This is only needed for the wireless remote radio mode.

    :::shell
    cube> sudo nmcli dev wifi connect '<ssid>' password '<password>'
    # get your ip
    cube> ip a

## Building and Running Socktap for Wireless Remote Radio Mode
You can build and run socktap directly on your personal computer (host) and select `cube-evk` as link-layer. Further, gpsd daemon is running on the EVK that can feed socktap with GNSS data. 

In `wireless remote radio mode` you develop, debug and run Vanetza/socktap on your personal computer. There is no need to flash or transfer the application onto your EVK. The V2X radio on the EVK listens for incoming requests from remote. Both devices need to be pingable from each other only.

    :::shell
    host> mkdir build && cd build
    host> cmake -DBUILD_SOCKTAP=ON -DSOCKTAP_WITH_CUBE_EVK=ON ..

    # use fix position data
    host> ./bin/socktap -l cube-evk -p static --cube-ip <cube-ip>

    # use the ublox module on the EVK for positioning data
    host> ./bin/socktap -l cube-evk -p gpsd --gpsd-host <cube-ip> --cube-ip <cube-ip>

Moreover, the integrated LTE module allows the user to do field tests with the EVK from remote.

## Building and Running Socktap on the EVK
You can also build and run socktap on the EVK itself and it will connect to the local V2X module.

    :::shell
    cube> mkdir build && cd build
    cube> cmake -DBUILD_SOCKTAP=ON -DSOCKTAP_WITH_CUBE_EVK=ON ..

    # use fix position data
    cube> ./bin/socktap -l cube-evk -p static

    # use the ublox module on the EVK for positioning data
    cube> ./bin/socktap -l cube-evk -p gpsd --gpsd-host 127.0.0.1
